I'm enthusiastic about Python and enjoy writing idiomatic code that is clean, easily readable, and scalable. I have been programming in Python for roughly 3 years now and I have worked on several of my own open source projects.

I believe that code should be easily extendable, well-documented, and possesses a team of passionate developers -- it's what makes open source projects great.
